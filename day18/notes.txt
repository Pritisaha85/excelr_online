what are callback functions
function that is passed as an argument to another function

callback hell(pyramid of doom)
----------------------------------
-is a situation where we have multiple callbacks inside a callback (nested callbacks)
---hard to read
---hard to maintain
--hard to debug
---this usually happens when we have to perform multiple asynchoromus operations

hence promises come into picture
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
what are promises
====================
a promis in js is an object that represents the outcome of an asynchronus operations
----it is used to handle the success and failure of an asyncrhonus operations
-----------------------------
 states in promises:
 1. pending intial states
 2. fulfilled the operation was successful
 3. rejected-the operation failed
 - we can use then() function to handle the success and failure of a promises
 - we can use catch() function to handle the success and failure of a promises
 -we can use finally() function to handle the success and failure of a promise
-----------------------------------
 async and await keywords



what is then() functionsasync and await functions
Promise.all()
Promise.race()
Promise.allSetled()
Promise.all()
Jquery Integration
Eg on Jquery

----------------
-------------
-----------------
async and await

async:
 - are functions that return a promise
 -are used to handle asyncohromous operations
  syntax:

  async function functionName(){

  }
  await:
  ----------
  used to wait for a promise to resolve
  -used inside an async function
  -it will make code synchronous

  syntax:
  async function functionName{
    await functionName();}
  --------------
  authentication:
  succes:welcome user
  update userdelte user 
  profile
  failure:login fail
  eg:
  authentication(success{
    welcom user()
    update user()
    delte profile()

  }
  ===============
 Promise.all()
 -it is used to wait for all the promises to resolbe
 -it returns a promise
 -it is used to handle multiple promieses(asyncrhonus operations)
 -it is used to handle multiple promioses(asynscronus operations)
 -if all sucess it returns array of valu
 -if any one fails it gives errors

----------------------------
 Promise.race()
 -IT IS USE TO WAIT FOR the first promise to resolve
 -it returns a promise
 -it is used to hadnle multiple(asynchronous operations)
 -------------------
 Promise.allSettled()
 -used to wait for alll promises to resolve 
 -it returns a promise
  -it is used to hadnle multiple(asynchronous operations)
  -wait for alll promises and tells 
  1. whic one success
  2. which one passed

 ----------------------------
 feaature| .all | .race |.allSettled
 wait for all|yyeses|no|yyeses
 fails fast |on first reject|if first rejects|never fails
 use case| all must success|if first win|all outcomes get 
 return| array| first value|all results with status|
 ------------------------------
 JQuery 
 --jquery is fast,small js library
 use: dom manipulation
 event handling
 animation
 ajax(api-http requests)
------it is easier than compared js
 JQuery Integration
--- use cdn
 Examples on JQUERY
